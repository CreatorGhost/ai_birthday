If you need the exact restaurant seating count or want to reserve tables for a birthday or group visit, our Sales & Information Desk (located at the main entrance opposite reception) can provide the precise capacity, confirm table availability, and advise on POD-holder discounts or special arrangements.

Would you like me to check availability or make a reservation for a specific date, time, and party size? I can help arrange it.

Our Yas Mall location does have a family restaurant that caters to both kids and adults, with direct access from the mall corridors and stroller/wheelchairâ€‘friendly routes (escalator and lift access). The venue is fully indoors and airâ€‘conditioned yearâ€‘round, so itâ€™s comfortable for dining while you watch the kids play.

However, the exact seating capacity for the Yas Mall restaurant isnâ€™t listed in the information I have. For a precise number (and to confirm any PODâ€‘holder discounts or current offers), the fastest option is to contact our Sales & Information Desk at the main entrance (opposite reception) â€” they handle bookings, table reservations, birthday packages, and can give you upâ€‘toâ€‘date details.

Would you like me to check availability or confirm the restaurant capacity and discount options for a specific date/time or party size? I can do that for you right away.

Yes â€” socks are mandatory in all play zones at Leo & Loona for hygiene and safety. If you forget to bring them, we sell socks at the entrance/reception:

- Kids socks: 5 AED  
- Adults socks: 8 AED

Youâ€™re welcome to bring your own clean, nonâ€‘slip socks if you prefer. A quick reminder: tie long hair back and remove loose jewelry or scarves before play so everyone stays safe and comfy.

Would you like me to note that youâ€™ll need kidsâ€™ socks or tell you where to pick them up when you arrive?

Thanks for asking â€” Iâ€™m happy to help. For Leo & Loona at Yas Mall, our information notes that we have a family restaurant/cafÃ© that caters to both kids and adults (located inside the park for convenient supervision), but the exact seating capacity for the Yas Mall restaurant isnâ€™t specified in the materials I have.

What I can tell you right away:
- The park itself accommodates up to 500 guests at a time.
- The cafÃ©/dining area is family-focused and accessible from the main mall corridors (stroller- and wheelchair-friendly).
- For bookings, birthday support, and any seating or reservation questions, our Sales & Information Desk is located at the main entrance opposite the reception â€” they can confirm exact seating numbers and reserve tables or party dining spaces for you.

Would you like me to:
- check and confirm the exact seating capacity for Yas Mall (I can contact the team for you), or
- help you make a reservation or book a party dining area?

Iâ€™m here to make your visit easy and magical! âœ¨

At Leo & Loona Yas Mall the restaurant is a family-friendly cafÃ©/dining area that caters to both kids and adults â€” perfect for families, birthday parties and group visits. Itâ€™s directly accessible from the main mall corridors, stroller- and wheelchair-friendly, and located inside our fully airâ€‘conditioned indoor venue.

I donâ€™t have a published seating-capacity number for the Yas Mall restaurant in my records. For an idea of scale, our Dalma Mall restaurant seats about 165 guests, and the Yas Mall park itself can host up to 500 visitors at a time â€” so the dining area is designed to comfortably support family dining and event groups.

If youâ€™d like the exact restaurant seating capacity, to check availability, or to make a table or party reservation (including POD-holder discount details), our Sales & Information Desk at the main entrance opposite reception can help â€” they handle bookings and all event arrangements. Would you like me to help prepare details for a reservation (date, time, party size)?
