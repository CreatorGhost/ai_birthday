Yes â€” you can use the washroom. We have restroom facilities nearby (and family/babyâ€‘change and accessible restrooms are usually available in the mall near our Leo & Loona entrance). A team member will happily point you to the closest one or escort you if you need help.

Quick reminders:
- Please use restrooms and babyâ€‘changing facilities outside of play/activity areas.  
- Children under 6 must be directly supervised by an adult.  
- Remember socks are required to reâ€‘enter play zones â€” please put them on before going back.

Tell me which Leo & Loona location youâ€™re at (Yas Mall, Festival City, or Dalma Mall) and Iâ€™ll give you exact directions right away.
