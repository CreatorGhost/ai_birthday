Oh, lovely â€” Iâ€™d be happy to help! Do you mean general prices for socks, or are you asking about socks sold at our Leo & Loona gift shop? Either way, hereâ€™s a quick, friendly price guide and some helpful tips to pick the right pair.

Typical price ranges (UAE, approximate)
- Baby/infant socks: AED 5â€“15 per pair; multipacks (3â€“5 pairs) AED 10â€“30.  
- Kids / character socks: AED 10â€“25 per single pair; 3â€‘pack AED 20â€“50.  
- Everyday adult socks (basic cotton): AED 10â€“25 per pair; 3â€“6 pack AED 30â€“80.  
- Performance / athletic socks (moistureâ€‘wicking, cushioned): AED 25â€“80 per pair.  
- Branded / premium socks (merino, designer): AED 80â€“200+ per pair.  
- Novelty or LED socks: AED 25â€“60.  
- Bulk/wholesale: often AED 3â€“8 per pair depending on quantity and quality.

Shopping tips
- Material matters: cotton blends for everyday, merino for breathability/warmth, synthetic blends for sports.  
- Size & fit: check age/size charts for children â€” sizes vary by brand.  
- Care: follow washing instructions to keep elasticity and prints longer.  
- Bundles: multipacks often give the best value for basics.  
- Where to look in the UAE: supermarkets and hypermarkets (Carrefour, Lulu), fashion retailers (H&M, Zara), sports stores (Decathlon), online (Namshi, Amazon.ae) â€” plus local markets for bargains.

If you meant park merchandise: we sometimes carry themed Leo & Loona socks in our gift shop â€” if youâ€™re visiting, Iâ€™d be delighted to check current stock or let you know any seasonal offers. Would you like me to look up specific styles, sizes, or stores (and which currency you prefer)? ðŸŽˆ
