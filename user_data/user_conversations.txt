Great question — I’d love to help. For Leo & Loona at Yas Mall we have a family restaurant that caters to both kids and adults as part of the venue (which overall can host up to 500 guests). However, our records don’t list a specific seating capacity number for the Yas Mall restaurant.

If you need the exact restaurant seating count or want to reserve tables for a birthday or group visit, our Sales & Information Desk (located at the main entrance opposite reception) can provide the precise capacity, confirm table availability, and advise on POD-holder discounts or special arrangements.

Would you like me to check availability or make a reservation for a specific date, time, and party size? I can help arrange it.

Yes — socks are mandatory in all play zones at Leo & Loona for hygiene and safety (better grip and cleaner play for everyone). If you bring your own, please use clean, non‑slip socks. 

If you’re visiting our Dalma location, we sell socks at the venue (kids: 5 AED, adults: 8 AED). At other locations (like our Yas Mall venue), socks are also available for purchase at the entrance or retail desk, though prices may vary.

Would you like me to add socks to a booking or check what’s available at the location you’ll be visiting?

Our Yas Mall location does have a family restaurant that caters to both kids and adults, with direct access from the mall corridors and stroller/wheelchair‑friendly routes (escalator and lift access). The venue is fully indoors and air‑conditioned year‑round, so it’s comfortable for dining while you watch the kids play.

However, the exact seating capacity for the Yas Mall restaurant isn’t listed in the information I have. For a precise number (and to confirm any POD‑holder discounts or current offers), the fastest option is to contact our Sales & Information Desk at the main entrance (opposite reception) — they handle bookings, table reservations, birthday packages, and can give you up‑to‑date details.

Would you like me to check availability or confirm the restaurant capacity and discount options for a specific date/time or party size? I can do that for you right away.

Yes — socks are mandatory in all play zones at Leo & Loona for hygiene and safety. If you forget to bring them, we sell socks at the entrance/reception:

- Kids socks: 5 AED  
- Adults socks: 8 AED

You’re welcome to bring your own clean, non‑slip socks if you prefer. A quick reminder: tie long hair back and remove loose jewelry or scarves before play so everyone stays safe and comfy.

Would you like me to note that you’ll need kids’ socks or tell you where to pick them up when you arrive?

Thanks for asking — I’m happy to help. For Leo & Loona at Yas Mall, our information notes that we have a family restaurant/café that caters to both kids and adults (located inside the park for convenient supervision), but the exact seating capacity for the Yas Mall restaurant isn’t specified in the materials I have.

What I can tell you right away:
- The park itself accommodates up to 500 guests at a time.
- The café/dining area is family-focused and accessible from the main mall corridors (stroller- and wheelchair-friendly).
- For bookings, birthday support, and any seating or reservation questions, our Sales & Information Desk is located at the main entrance opposite the reception — they can confirm exact seating numbers and reserve tables or party dining spaces for you.

Would you like me to:
- check and confirm the exact seating capacity for Yas Mall (I can contact the team for you), or
- help you make a reservation or book a party dining area?

I’m here to make your visit easy and magical! ✨

At Leo & Loona Yas Mall the restaurant is a family-friendly café/dining area that caters to both kids and adults — perfect for families, birthday parties and group visits. It’s directly accessible from the main mall corridors, stroller- and wheelchair-friendly, and located inside our fully air‑conditioned indoor venue.

I don’t have a published seating-capacity number for the Yas Mall restaurant in my records. For an idea of scale, our Dalma Mall restaurant seats about 165 guests, and the Yas Mall park itself can host up to 500 visitors at a time — so the dining area is designed to comfortably support family dining and event groups.

If you’d like the exact restaurant seating capacity, to check availability, or to make a table or party reservation (including POD-holder discount details), our Sales & Information Desk at the main entrance opposite reception can help — they handle bookings and all event arrangements. Would you like me to help prepare details for a reservation (date, time, party size)?

Great question — here’s everything you need to know about socks at Leo & Loona:

- Are socks required?  
  Yes — for hygiene and safety we ask all guests to wear socks in our play areas (soft play, trampolines, slides, phygital zones and party rooms). This helps keep surfaces clean and reduces slipping.

- Best type to bring:  
  - Clean, closed-toe socks (cotton blend is comfortable).  
  - Non-slip/grip socks are strongly recommended for little ones and for trampoline or slippery surfaces.  
  - Bring a spare pair in case they get wet or dirty.

- Toddlers & babies:  
  Anti-slip socks are ideal in the toddler padded area. If a child is very small or crawling, socks help with cleanliness but consider comfort and temperature.

- If you forget socks:  
  Ask Guest Services when you arrive — we can usually help with disposable options or direct you to nearby retail shops in the mall. Our on-site retail area sells official Leo & Loona merchandise (dresses, sports equipment and toys); Guest Services will point you to the best place for socks if needed.

- Practical tips:  
  - Label socks for parties or groups to avoid mix-ups.  
  - Avoid socks with large hard decorations that could be uncomfortable on play equipment.

By the way, we’re currently running our Educational Months program — if you’re visiting soon, it pairs nicely with our interactive zones. Would you like me to send today’s schedule or check Guest Services availability for disposable socks?
[2025-09-01 10:57:02] | Phone: +971529956073 | Name: Samual | USER: ok

Would you like me to help with any of these for your visit to Leo & Loona?
1) Check Guest Services availability for disposable or non‑slip socks  
2) Send today’s schedule (shows shows, activities, and character appearances)  
3) Find directions to a specific zone (toddler area, trampoline, phygital area, etc.)  
4) Check party room availability or booking details  
5) Ticket info or special offers for today

Tell me the number (or type your question) and I’ll take care of it. I’m excited to help you plan a magical visit!

Great question — socks are a small thing that make a big difference at Leo & Loona. Here’s a friendly guide to help you and your little ones stay safe, comfortable, and park-ready:

- Why socks matter here
  - For hygiene and safety: we ask guests to wear socks in soft-play areas, trampolines, interactive/mixed-reality zones and some party rooms to keep surfaces clean and prevent slips.
  - Grip and comfort: non-slip (grip) socks reduce falls on bouncy or smooth surfaces.

- What kind of socks to bring
  - Non-slip/grip socks (recommended for toddlers through adults).
  - Breathable cotton or cotton-blend for comfort; avoid slippery or worn-out soles.
  - Ankle or crew length — full coverage helps keep feet secure during play.
  - No metal decorations or zippers that could scratch play surfaces.

- Practical tips
  - Bring an extra pair for little ones — accidents happen and a dry clean pair keeps play pleasant.
  - Label socks (or use a small sticker) if you’re visiting with a group — easier to reunite with lost items.
  - Replace socks with holes or very thin soles — they lose grip and wear quickly.

- Buying socks at the park
  - Our retail area carries official Leo & Loona merchandise, including kid- and adult-sized socks — fun designs and grip options. Our team can help you pick the right size.

- Care & longevity
  - Wash in cool water, tumble low or air-dry; avoid bleach. Replace frequently for growing kids or when tread wears thin.

If you’re coming today or soon, we’re currently running our Educational Months — would you like me to send the daily schedule or check sock availability in our shop for you?

Great question — our retail area mainly stocks Leo & Loona dresses, sports equipment, and toys, so we don’t usually carry everyday socks in the shop. Please bring a clean pair of socks for each child, as socks are required in several play areas (soft play, trampoline, and some multisensory zones) for hygiene and safety. If you forget yours, stop by Guest Services when you arrive — they’ll be happy to help and can point you to nearby shops that sell socks.
